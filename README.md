# Quantitative Finance

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! This repository documents my journey in learning quantitative finance - from fundamental concepts to practical implementations. I'm sharing my progress, code, and insights to track my growth and potentially help others on a similar path. The qf_util.py file contains all the classes and functions used in the Jupyter Notebooks. Feel free to use and adapt them for your purposes.

ðŸ’» My Projects
1. **Statistical Arbitrage Pair Finder**: A rule-based approach to identify potential statistical arbitrage trading pairs. The biggest challenge was calculating the Hurst Exponent and verifying the result. I simulated stock price processes using a random walk and a Vasicek model to compare the Hurst Exponent output for a trending and a mean-reverting process.

2. **Simple Backtesting Framework**: A simple back tester records the trades of a rudimentary Price/SMA cross strategy. The focus was on the backtesting and the calculation of the evaluation metrics rather than the strategy's profitability. The evaluation metrics consider both the risk-adjusted return (Sharpe, Treynor, Sortino) perspective and the emotional side (Maximum Drawdown and Lose Streaks).
